Note about making bootstrap responsive on mobile devices
Section 7, Lecture 84
Hi Everyone!

If you want your bootstrap styled website to be responsive on mobile then be sure to add the following meta tag to your <head>  element, above the <title>  tag:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

As a side note, if you can't get the <hr> element to appear correctly on mobile devices then see here for a fix.

Thanks,
Ian
